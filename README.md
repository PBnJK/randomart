# RandomArt

Simple C implementation of the RandomArt generation algorithm described on this
[paper](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf).

Inspired by tsoding's [implementation](https://github.com/tsoding/randomart),
though no code is shared! Borrowed the idea of using a memory arena to speed up
and reduce allocations (memory usage was absurd!!!!!) but the implementation is
my own. Never touched the concept before, so it was fun...

Thanks tsoding :â€‹-D

TODO: rewrite, it's 23:58 right now...
